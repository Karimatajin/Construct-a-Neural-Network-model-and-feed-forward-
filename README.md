# Construct-a-Neural-Network-model-and-feed-forward-


This project sought to build a neural network that trains and tests data without using built-in Python packages like Keras or Tensorflow. 
'Dummy' data was used with 5 input features and 2 output features. The sigmoid and ReLu functions were both tested as activation functions and gradient descent was employed to optimize the SSR value. 
The code below displays the structure and process I went through the build the network.
